Goal of app: improved outcome for individuals suffering from hoarding.

Audience
===============
Individuals with hoarding issues, professionals such as EMTs that may come across these individuals while going about their jobs, people involved in helping hoarding individuals.

Issues to be addressed
===============
Professionals such as EMTs ect often come across hoarders and don’t know what to do about it, who to go to about it outsiders.
There are a lot of individuals involved with helping hoarders but hardly any communication between them (fire department, therapists, houseing regulators, ect.) professionals.
Hoarders often need help when facing their issues, without help they can face safety issues or get their homes taken away or cleaned out by regulators which can be emotionally and fiscally damaging hoarders.  

Possible solutions discussed (may or may not be practical)
===============
Assessment: provide some rule of thumb guideline to identify hoarders helps hoarders/outsiders.
Is the house following safety guidelines?                                              
Picture assessment.
Give access information/resources helps hoarders/outsiders.
Communication helps professionals/outsiders.
Some sort of way for professionals to indicate houses of hoarders to other professionals; its valuable for firemen to know where dangerous houses are before they have to face them ect; but this information couldn’t be public.
Gps locations.
Take pictures, put notes on them, post for other professionals to reference.
Getting better: ties in with information/resources? helps hoarders.
What do I do next?
What are the (my?) overall goals for cleaning up?
Some sort of progress tracking system, keep track of milestones.
